# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Pokemon Team Builder application.

## Testing Philosophy

The testing strategy follows the Testing Trophy approach:
- **Static Testing**: TypeScript for type checking
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components and hooks
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Manual testing of key user flows

## Test Stack

- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing with a focus on user behavior
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Test Utilities**: Custom test utilities for provider wrapping and mocking

## Test Organization

Tests are organized alongside the code they test, following the pattern:

    ```
    src/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── common/
    │   │   ├── PaginationControls.tsx
    │   │   └── tests/
    │   │       └── PaginationControls.test.tsx
    ├── hooks/
    │   ├── useTeams.ts
    │   └── tests/
    │       └── useTeams.test.ts
    ```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components and hooks in isolation:

- **Component Tests**: Verify rendering, user interactions, and state changes
- **Hook Tests**: Verify behavior and state management of custom hooks
- **Utility Tests**: Verify the functionality of utility functions

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly:

- **Component Composition**: Testing nested components
- **Context Integration**: Testing components with context providers
- **API Integration**: Testing components with mocked API responses

## Mocking Strategy

The application uses Jest's mocking capabilities for:

- **API Responses**: Mock fetch/axios requests
- **Context Values**: Mock context providers with controlled values
- **Router**: Mock navigation and routing functionality
- **Supabase**: Mock authentication and database operations

## Test Utilities

The project includes several test utilities to facilitate testing:

- **renderWithProviders**: Render components with necessary providers
- **createMockUser**: Create mock user data
- **createMockPokemon**: Create mock Pokemon data
- **createMockTeam**: Create mock team data

## Test Coverage

Test coverage focuses on critical paths and business logic:

- User authentication flows
- Team creation and management
- Pokemon search and filtering
- Type analysis functionality

## Running Tests

Tests can be run with the following npm scripts:

- **All Tests**: `npm test`
- **Watch Mode**: `npm run test:watch`
- **Coverage Report**: `npm run test:coverage`
- **Error Analysis**: `npm run test:with-report`

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Tests run on every push and pull request
2. Deployment only proceeds if tests pass
3. Test failures prevent merging of pull requests

## Manual Testing

In addition to automated tests, manual testing is performed for:

- Responsive design across different devices
- Browser compatibility
- Authentication flows
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing
